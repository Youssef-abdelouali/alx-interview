# 0x05. N Queens

## Description

The **N Queens** problem is a classic challenge in computer science and mathematics that involves placing **N** queens on an **N×N** chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. This project is designed to help you implement an efficient solution using the **backtracking algorithm** in Python. 

In this project, you'll explore and apply essential concepts including backtracking, recursion, list manipulation, and handling command-line arguments in Python. Successfully solving this problem requires strong problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

## Concepts Needed

### Backtracking Algorithms
- Backtracking is used to explore all possible solutions and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.
- **Resources:** 
  - [Backtracking Introduction](#)

### Recursion
- Recursive functions play a key role in implementing the backtracking algorithm.
- **Resources:** 
  - [Recursion in Python](#)

### List Manipulations in Python
- Lists are used to store the positions of queens on the chessboard.
- **Resources:** 
  - [Python Lists](#)

### Python Command Line Arguments
- Handle command-line arguments with the `sys` module.
- **Resources:** 
  - [Command Line Arguments in Python](#)

By understanding these concepts, you'll be equipped to tackle the N Queens problem effectively.
